Water quality analyzer can binding.

ðŸš§ _Work In Progress_ ðŸš§

**TODO:**  Driver?

## Communication uber `jsonrpc`

```shell
cargo add jsonrpc-core
cargo add jsonrpc-delive
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment

## Testing

Integrating the test into a CI system is non-trivial as it relies on a `vcan0` virtual can device existing. Adding one to most linux systems is pretty easy with root access but attaching a vcan device to a container for CI seems difficult to find support for.

To run the tests locally, though, setup should be simple:

```sh
sudo modprobe vcan
sudo ip link add vcan0 type vcan
sudo ip link set vcan0 up
cargo test
```
