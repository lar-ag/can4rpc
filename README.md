# `canbus`

🚧 _Work In Progress_ 🚧

**TODO:**  Driver?
**TODO:**  API ?



## 🚀 Deployment

## Testing

Integrating the test into a CI system is non-trivial as it relies on a `vcan0` virtual can device existing. Adding one to most linux systems is pretty easy with root access but attaching a vcan device to a container for CI seems difficult to find support for.

To run the tests locally, though, setup should be simple:

```sh
sudo modprobe vcan
sudo ip link add vcan0 type vcan
sudo ip link set vcan0 up
cargo test
```
