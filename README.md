Water quality analyzer can binding.

**TODO:**  Driver?

## ï’ž Compiling

Requires Rust nightly. To compile using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/):

```ShellSession
$ rustup toolchain install nightly
$ rustup default nightly
$ cargo build
```

Be sure to switch back to `stable` with `rustup default stable` if that's your preferred toolchain.


To cross-compile for the Raspberry Pi you will need an
`gcc-multilib-i686-linux-gnu` GCC toolchain and Rust component installed. Add the Rust target
with `rustup target add i686-unknown-linux-gnu`. Then you can
cross-compile with `cargo`:

```ShellSession
    cargo build --release --target i686-unknown-linux-gnu
```

`target/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/release/wqm-uv`

## Communication uber `jsonrpc`

```shell
cargo add jsonrpc-core
cargo add jsonrpc-delive
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment

## Testing

Integrating the test into a CI system is non-trivial as it relies on a `vcan0` virtual can device existing. Adding one to most linux systems is pretty easy with root access but attaching a vcan device to a container for CI seems difficult to find support for.

To run the tests locally, though, setup should be simple:

```sh
sudo modprobe vcan
sudo ip link add vcan0 type vcan
sudo ip link set vcan0 up
cargo test
```
